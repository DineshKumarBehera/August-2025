Q.Can you explain your experience with microservices architecture and how you implemented it in your projects?

A. In my 8.5 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I have extensively utilized microservices architecture, especially during my tenure at Capgemini Technology Services and Wipro Technology. My current project involves Wealth Management for the Royal Bank of Canada, where I designed and developed RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints to facilitate seamless communication between React-based frontend applications and backend microservices. This involved creating a decoupled architecture that ensures individual services could be developed, tested, and deployed independently. This design choice not only boosts scalability but also simplifies maintenance and enhances performance. In a previous role at Wipro, I contributed to an automated network operations platform where I implemented microservices to handle high-volume network requests more efficiently than traditional monolithic applications. By adopting Spring Boot, I was able to create lightweight services that could easily scale according to demand. I also utilized containerization tools like Docker to deploy these microservices, which enhanced the portability and ease of deployment in different environments, including AWS. This approach allowed my team to continuously integrate and deploy updates, achieving a more agile development process. The implementation of microservices has also allowed me to apply robust security practices, utilizing OAuth2 and JWT for secure API access, which I have employed in various financial industry projects. Implementing messaging queues like Apache Kafka added an extra layer of resilience, enabling asynchronous communication between services. Overall, my experience reflects a strong belief in the benefits of microservices architecture, enabling teams to be more agile while delivering high-quality applications.


Q.What strategies have you used for maintaining API security in your applications?


A. Maintaining API security has been a critical aspect of my work, especially given the sensitive nature of the data involved in financial applications and network management systems. My experience has equipped me with various strategies to ensure robust API security. A primary technique I've employed is leveraging industry-standard protocols like OAuth2 for authentication. This was particularly crucial in my current role at Capgemini while working with RESTful APIs and integrating OAuth2 with JWT for secure client-server communication. By implementing token-based authentication, I have been able to provide secure access to resources without exposing sensitive user credentials. Additionally, I have incorporated Spring Security at the application level, which allows for configuring security settings declaratively or programmatically. This included defining roles and permissions, ensuring only authorized users could access specific endpoints. In projects involving the Royal Bank of Canada, I emphasized strict access controls, ensuring compliance with financial regulations while safeguarding sensitive client data. In conjunction with security mechanisms, I have ensured that all API requests are validated thoroughly to prevent injection attacks. Implementing rate limiting to guard against DDoS attacks is another essential approach Iâ€™ve applied, particularly in high-traffic environments. Logging and monitoring are paramount; I have used tools like Splunk to log API requests, enabling real-time monitoring and swift reaction to any unauthorised access attempts. During code reviews, I actively promote a security-first mindset among my team members, encouraging them to consider potential vulnerabilities during the development life cycle. I continuously keep up with emerging threats and security best practices, attending workshops and training sessions that further inform my approach to API security.

Q.How do you ensure performance optimization in your applications, especially on the backend?

A. Performance optimization has been a key focus in my projects, particularly in backend development, where the efficiency of data processing directly impacts user experience. At Capgemini Technology Services, working on the Wealth Management project for the Royal Bank of Canada, I developed RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints that needed to handle considerable traffic efficiently. One of the strategies I implemented involved optimizing database queries through effective indexing and query tuning. By analyzing query performance and eliminating bottlenecks, I was able to significantly improve response times for our APIs. In addition to database optimization, I took a microservices approach which allowed individual services to be scaled independently. For example, we utilized Apache Kafka for asynchronous processing, enabling different microservices to communicate efficiently without blocking each other. This was crucial for enhancing overall system responsiveness, especially under peak load conditions. Another technique I employed was caching. I reduced redundant database calls by implementing caching strategies at various layers, utilizing tools like Redis. Cache invalidation strategies were carefully planned to ensure data consistency, particularly in critical applications, allowing quick access to frequently requested data. Furthermore, CI/CD pipelines equipped with automated performance testing tools have been indispensable in our development process. This enables early detection of performance degradation, allowing the team to address issues before they reach production. Metrics are gathered using Prometheus and Grafana, giving us real-time insights into application performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for ongoing improvements. Overall, a combination of strategic database management, microservices architecture, caching, and continuous performance testing forms the backbone of my approach to backend performance optimization.

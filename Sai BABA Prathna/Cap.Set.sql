As a Senior Software Engineer at Capgemini, I worked on modernizing RBC’s Wealth Management SaaS platform by transforming legacy systems into a scalable, real-time solution using Java 17, Spring WebFlux, and reactive microservices. This ensured zero downtime for multi-billion-dollar portfolio management. One of my key projects was the ROADTOCLOUD module as part of the RBC USWM ADM 2022-2025 (ROAD) initiative. ROAD is a security certificate tracking system originally built in 1997 and updated in 2007. It was used by around 75 employees in RBC’s operations and alternative investment group. As the system aged, non-compliance issues started to crop up, and flexibility became a concern. To address this, we decided to modernize it as part of RBC’s larger security and robustness program. The goal was to migrate the application to a cloud platform, upgrade its tech stack, and resolve these long-standing issues. I helped design and implement high-performance RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints to automate complex financial workflows, which ended up reducing the advisor workload by over 30%. This allowed advisors to focus more on building client relationships. I also worked on implementing event-driven architecture using Kafka and RabbitMQ to enable sub-second real-time portfolio alerts, which drastically improved responsiveness. On top of that, I made sure to enforce OAuth2/JWT security protocols to ensure we remained compliant with FINTRAC and GDPR standards for handling sensitive financial data. My work spans Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, AWS, and React.js, with a strong focus on scalability, performance, and creating meaningful impacts for end users.

Leveraging Java 17, Spring WebFlux, and reactive microservices, helped ensure zero downtime for RBC’s multi-billion-dollar portfolio management. One of the standout projects was the ROADTOCLOUD module, part of RBC’s USWM ADM 2022-2025 initiative. The project focused on upgrading a security certificate tracking system that had been in place since 1997 but had become increasingly outdated and prone to non-compliance issues.

The system, used by about 75 employees in RBC’s operations and alternative investment teams, was in desperate need of modernization. This led to migrating the application to the cloud, updating its tech stack, and resolving long-standing issues. Designed and implemented high-performance RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints to automate complex financial workflows, reducing advisor workload by over 30%. This allowed them to shift focus back to building stronger client relationships.

In addition to improving workflows, worked on implementing event-driven architecture using Kafka and RabbitMQ to enable sub-second real-time portfolio alerts, significantly boosting responsiveness. To ensure security and compliance, OAuth2 and JWT were integrated, meeting FINTRAC and GDPR standards for handling sensitive financial data.

Throughout the project, worked with Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, AWS, and React.js, always prioritizing scalability, performance, and meaningful impact for end users.

I'm comfortable with the full stack, primarily using Java and Spring Boot for back-end development, and React for the front end, often integrating Kafka or RabbitMQ. I focus on creating secure, scalable, and reliable systems. A key project was transforming RBC's legacy Wealth Management system into modern microservices, achieving zero downtime during the transition and improving workflows by 30% with new REST and GraphQL APIs. I also set up real-time Kafka alerts, speeding up financial decisions by 50%. I'm skilled with CI/CD (Jenkins, Kubernetes) and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), ensuring compliance (GDPR, FINTRAC). Security is crucial to me (OAuth2, JWT). I've also built automation tools for Comcast and Volvo. I’m passionate about creating clean, efficient tech and seeking a team that values smart scaling and building impactful solutions.

Hello, my name is Dinesh Kumar Behera. I am a Senior Software Engineer with 8 years of experience in Java development, mainly working with Spring Boot, microservices, and cloud technologies.

Currently, I am working on a project called 'RoadToCloud' for RBC, through Capgemini. In this project, we are modernizing an old wealth management certificate tracking system. We are moving it from a legacy technology stack to a modern setup using Java, Spring Boot-based microservices, and a React front-end.

Our goal is to make the system scalable, secure, and reliable. We are also focusing on automated deployment. To achieve this, we are using modern design patterns like CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and event-driven architecture.

Worked on the Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC) management system for Volvo trucks, revolutionizing global vehicle diagnostics by automating fault code interpretation and repair workflows. The platform replaced legacy systems with a Spring Boot microservices architecture, containerized using Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes EKS for scalable, cloud-native deployment. It integrated Elasticsearch for real-time diagnostic analysis and Kafka for event-driven communication between vehicle ECUs and dealer systems. RESTful APIs standardized data exchange across the service network, while OAuth 2.0, JWT and AWS KMS enforced secure access, fully compliant with ISO 14229 and SAE J1939 automotive standards. CI/CD pipelines with automated testing supported fast and reliable deployment. Additionally, Redis caching was implemented to enhance performance for frequently accessed diagnostic patterns.
